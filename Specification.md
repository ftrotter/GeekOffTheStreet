## Geek Off The Street Specification

### Overview
The data from regulations.gov, specifically the comment data, is too hard to get. 
I want to make it possible for geeks to download massive amounts of comment data (in its 'native' JSON) formats easily


### Non goals
I do not much care about: 

* Having a browsing interface of the data. That is what [docket wrench](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2013/01/31/docket-wrench-exposing-trends-regulatory-comments/) is, and this is not that. 


### Interfaces

* Several torrent files. That allow for the downloading of very large chunks of docket, comment data. 
* API that closely mimics the one available from [Regulations.gov API](https://regulationsgov.github.io/developers/)
