Each state is currently governed by themselves to ensure their facilities are managed to that said states expectations and administrative standards. It would be easier for citizens, and residents of states to commute or relocate to alternative states, while ensuring their healthcare needs will be met without glitches. In addition, if there was a national clearinghouse of providers, this would force all organizations to meet one standard of admin and accreditation needs.<br/><br/> CMS-0058-NC",
