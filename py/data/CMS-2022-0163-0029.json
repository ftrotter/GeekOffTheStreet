It will help to facilitate and improve care delivery, ensuring that care providers are available to meet patient needs.  <br/><br/>A National Provider Database will make it easier for providers to present their credentials to healthcare delivery networks and make it easier for those credentials to be verified.  It will provide much needed information regarding the availability of various provider specialties and the healthcare diversity and equity across our country. <br/><br/>This transparency is much needed, and we support the development of this important tool.",
