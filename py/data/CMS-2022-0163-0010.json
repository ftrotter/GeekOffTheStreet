I&#39;ve always said to be people an accurate provider directory would be the most lucrative start-up if it worked.  It is a huge pain not just as a healthcare delivery system, but as a consumer of healthcare there is no such thing as an accurate directory to find the right provider.<br/>Here is what I suggest, if providers want to receive CMS payments they be required to update their NPPES profile annually and double check the specialty listed.  Included here can be all of their information that should be included in the directory e.g., address, phone number, populations served, employer, etc.  Please please make this happen.  Happy to provide specific examples and suggestions.",
