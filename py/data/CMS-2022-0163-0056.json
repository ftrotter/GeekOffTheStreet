The present system is very time consuming; the majority of health care providers have few office staff who have multiple duties and having to refill directory updates every 3 months for each of the medicare advantage and Medicaid plans takes these staff off of other duties essential for the practice. Additionally, many of the forms have to filled out in their entirety every time, they do not have a method for the provider to indicate that all information remains the same.",
