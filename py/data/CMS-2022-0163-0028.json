      "comment" : "The NPPES uploads have been a struggle for us companywide due to NPPES account set ups, providers not knowing their login and passwords and the surrogacy access is cumbersome. The bulk upload option was not feasible for us due to the various provider employment status&rsquo; that we see enterprise wide. It requires a fulltime person to maintain and update the system for our over 1200 existing providers and new onboarding providers.  With staffing shortages and lean support, we are not able to place someone in the role fulltime and we have found the process a very time-consuming task to add to an existing staff member. This leads to inaccuracies and confusion to our patients as well as other providers who refer to us.  We feel that consolidating data directories would help improve access and patient choice by making it easier for patients and providers to identify, compare and locate providers to meet their needs.
