I manage over 100 practitioners&#39; data in our local Hospital/Healthcare Group.  <br/><br/>My concern though, is will CMS require the commercial and government based payers to utilize this Directory?  As it happens now, I must report directly to Medicare, Medicaid, HNFS/Tricare, Premera Blue Cross, and MODA, in addition to already maintaining the CAQH profile on behalf of each Practitioner.  So, I have doubts that other Payers will in fact utilize this new CMS National Directory.  Will it just become yet another database I must log into and update individual practitioners?  ",
