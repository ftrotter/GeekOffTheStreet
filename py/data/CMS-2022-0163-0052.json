      "comment" : "As the former president of New York Medical College and the co-founder of Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. I can offer over 30 years of direct experience in utilizing physician data bases. Based on that experience I strongly support the creation of a national provider data base. Consumers, the public, have an extremely difficult time finding accurate, useful information on physicians. The reason John K. Castle and I formed castle Connolly in 1992 was to help people find the best healthcare. To that end we surveyed physicians ( the first company to do so) and asked them to recommend the best of their peers, in their region and nationally, within their specialty and others. We coupled this nomination process with information gathered by our research team, headed by a physician. Our team needed to be trained to use various data bases in other to screen physicians. Most consumers do not have those skills in and do not know of the existence of these data bases. Consumers do not need a wealth of information, but they do need some critical data: specialty, board certification, medical school, residencies and fellowships,disciplinary  history, malpractice history, hospital appointments, insurance accepted, office location, if possible is the doctor accepting new patients. All of this should be available and would be of great use to consumers in selecting a physician.",
