      "comment" : "Hello,<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Thank you for an opportunity to comment about the potential for a National Directory of Healthcare Providers &amp; Services (NDH). As a consumer or patient,a National Directory of Healthcare Providers &amp; Services  has it&#39;s merits if it allows a more convenient treatment related provider/patient appointment.  A Federal provider data base would be beneficial to enhance connected treatment opportunities for rural health clinics and rural residential places such as houses,apartments,trailers etc.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>A centralized data hub would have significantly more meaning when combined with actual real time patient/provider connections made possible through broadband telemedicine sessions. And perhaps telephonic health related sessions.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>So in sum,it&#39;s my belief CMS and HHS consideration for a National Directory of Healthcare Providers&amp; Services has been thoughtful and proper. Furthermore,telemedicine through broadband connected devices is a critical consideration for enhancing rural america&#39;s health treatment opportunities. Doctors of specialty nationwide could consult with a nurse practitioner or staff at a rural health center anywhere in the nation. And further,Doctors of specialty nationwide could provide reasonable treatment related advice to rural home residents based on the available symptoms and OTC medical diagnostic tools or devices(blood pressure kits,digital thermometer,glucose meter etc).<br/><br/>I am a person with disabilities living in rural america.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.<br/><br/>--<br/>This submission may or may not contain error and or flaw.<br/><br/>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and or The Americans with Disabilities Act<br/><br/>shall apply.",
