It is exceptionally hard for LGBTQIA+ individuals to find affirming healthcare, especially in certain areas of the country, leading to traumatization/victimization in healthcare settings, outright denial of care by providers/practices, and avoidance of needed care by LGBTQIA+ patients. Having these options built-in to the directory would help decrease LGBTQIA+ health disparities, improving access to needed safe and affirming healthcare.  ",
