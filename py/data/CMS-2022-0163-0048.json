I have read many of the comment and can not figure out why they are thinking that CMS is putting together a National Directory of Healthcare professionals. This is not what this document is about as I read it. The document is about putting our medical records in a National Directory for Healthcare professional to access when they want to. I do not read that even the patients can access the records. I am a mother of a adult disabled person on life support. I am elderly. I do not want one bit of our private Health issues put on a National registry. I realize it will save Doctor&#39;s offices money and maybe give insight to some of what the patient&#39;s medical factors are but this is NOT anyone&#39;s business except ours. We pay more for insurance a month than the Doctor pays to keep up their systems. If $900.00 a month is going to bankrupt a Doctor then they need to go out of business. It is always about saving the Professional money and NEVER about saving the patient&#39;s money or privacy. This needs to stop. We pay out of pocket so much more than they do and we do not feel it is right of CMS to take away our privacy rights. ",
