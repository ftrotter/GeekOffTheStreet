Enhanced interoperability includes <br/><br/>auditing complaints with significant emphasis on provider patterns and practices that <br/><br/>negatively affect a beneficiary&#39;s betterment,well-being or otherwise it degrades a <br/><br/>beneficiary&#39;s experience considering an individual&#39;s medical,psychiatric and psychological <br/><br/>history which may lead to a fraud,waste and abuse investigation.<br/><br/>It&#39;s further recommended CMS use it&#39;s National Directory of Health Care Providers and Services <br/><br/>to establish a higher than BFCC-QIO level appeals process that includes an ALJ document review <br/><br/>to determine if substantial evidence supports the BFCC-QIO conclusions about all relevant <br/><br/>matters. If substantial evidence is not present,the BFCC-QIO must issue a corrective decision <br/><br/>with the most deference toward CMS programs and beneficiary protection based on the record <br/><br/>evidence before them.<br/><br/>--<br/>This submission may or may not contain error and or flaw.<br/><br/>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and or The Americans with Disabilities Act<br/><br/>shall apply.",
