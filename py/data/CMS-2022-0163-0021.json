If certain entities credential a physician, nurse practitioner or other provider type that information should be available to speed billing entities being accepted by insurers without the exponentially duplicative credentialing process which currently exists. The credentialing issue is is a little off-point but enabling this national directory is definitely needed for many reasons. The national directory should be set up in a way to enable additional fields for future use. This can help reduce the back-office paperwork.",
