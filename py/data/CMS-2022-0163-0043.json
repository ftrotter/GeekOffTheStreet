As necessary,CMS should seek congressional changes allowing the creation of non-emergency transportation services. Medical,Psychiatric or Psychological conditions can prohibit and or cause difficulties with self transportation.  It&#39;s recommended CMS seek congressional changes if necessary to establish statewide partnerships that allows part B to reimburse private cab or transportation companies transporting medicare beneficiaries to and from medicare approved appointments. It&#39;s further recommended CMS seek congressional changes if necessary to consider an individualized assessment of a beneficiary&#39;s medical/psychiatric or psychological needs and expand non-emergency transportation to non-medical locations.
