Yes, it makes it convenient, but it also makes it convenient for <br/>outsiders to get that information too. Especially if done over the internet. It would seem better to have a system where it can be reviewed in one place (just to help compile data), but not to store it. What if something happens to the said place that holds all this information? It&#39;ll all be gone.<br/><br/>In the end, if you&#39;re just looking for convenience, this is the way to go. Though I&#39;m sure there is another way that could make it more convenient without the risk of losing a major amount of information in a bad scenario.",
