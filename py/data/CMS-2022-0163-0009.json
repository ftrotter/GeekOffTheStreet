This will be a low priority for providers particularly individual providers or small groups who do not have a person dedicate to updating information.  I often find that providers have not updated their NNPES information or even Medicare enrollment information (quit, died, moved).  Private insurance carriers have  to threaten their in-network providers with sanctions in order to get information updated/verified  in their systems.  So what makes you think that providers will take the time to update another data base?  ",
