      "comment" : "As a former health insurance consultant and advisor to dozens of retired friends and relatives selecting Medicare Advantage plans, I heartily endorse this effort (CMS-0058-NC) to establish a national directory of healthcare providers and services.  In addition to common problems, like incorrect or obsolete information on provider participation in various plan networks, I have often come across such other problems as:<br/><br/>1. Multiple names or changed names for physician groups or practices and even hospitals and broader health care systems. If a group has legitimate multiple names, all such names should be listed, cross-referenced, and searchable by the end user<br/><br/>2. Not finding a physician listed in a physician group, when the physician is indeed part of that group.<br/><br/>3. Ambiguity over whether all physicians within a physician group or facility accept the contracts with health plans that the group or facility as a whole accepts, such as for facility fees.  <br/><br/>I hope the directory project can address these challenges.",
