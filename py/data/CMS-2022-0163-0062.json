      "comment" : "Castle Connolly Top Doctors supports the development of a National Directory of Healthcare Providers &amp; Services (NDH). As the publisher of Castle Connolly Top Doctors, the largest network of peer-nominated physicians, we know first hand the challenges inherent in maintaining an accurate and up to date physician directory. Currently, Castle Connolly Top Doctors represent 63,000 doctors (the top 7 percent of doctors in the nation), who are all peer nominated and thoroughly validated by Castle Connolly&rsquo;s research team to ensure that they deliver the highest quality patient care. We thoroughly check each doctor&#39;s professional qualifications, education, hospital and faculty appointments, research leadership, professional reputation, disciplinary history and if available, outcomes data. With a National Directory of Healthcare Providers &amp; Services, consumers could use Castle Connolly&rsquo;s network to identify the Top Doctor, and then validate the contact and insurance information and other details at NDH.   <br/><br/>For the past 30 years, Castle Connolly&#39;s mission has been to help people find the best healthcare and connect patients with best-in-class healthcare providers. We believe that the NDH will help us get closer to this goal. Thank you. <br/>",
