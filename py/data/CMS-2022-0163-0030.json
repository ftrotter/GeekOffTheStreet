      "comment" : "a national directory of healthcare providers would be amazing. It will be a tremendous assistance to those in the State of Alaska who are doing member travel. In Alaska, we do not have all providers and/or all services available. It has improved greatly, but we still have to send folks out of state to get the care that is needed. Many children are sent to Seattle Children&#39;s for services. It is important that a list of services that a facility or doctor offers be part of this document. Under Medicaid guidelines, we have verify that the member has exhausted all resources in Alaska before we will agree to provide out of state travel. This document would be invaluable to any member anywhere in the country who is needing to travel anywhere else in the country and still has healthcare needs. Their provider would be able to look it up and verify if that provider is able to provide the requested service anywhere that they travel. A key word search will be needed to search this very large database. It would be great if this document were updated weekly or monthly. It should be no more than yearly, and hopefully much more often. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Cheryl Smith<br/>Service Authorization Manager<br/>Conduent/Alaska Medicaid <br/><br/>cheryl.smith@conduent.com<br/>907-644-8103",
