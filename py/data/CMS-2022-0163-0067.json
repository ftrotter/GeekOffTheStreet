      "comment" : "CMS-0058-NC<br/><br/>In creating a centralized data hub CMS could build upon the previous work in NPPES to help address some of these challenges. One driver of inaccuracy is the varying frequencies and levels of detail at which different directories require information.<br/><br/>A provider may be able to update their information one time, through a single point of entry in an NDH. Data should not be available only to CMS, but also publicly available for other payers and developers to utilize in their own directories and to the public using an API. It could include but not be limited to: the Medicare Provider, Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS), Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH), National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES), All Insurance company provider directories. <br/><br/>The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) is set up to establish a universal floor for interoperability across the country. The Common Agreement also includes requirements for maintaining a directory of exchange participants&#39; digital endpoints. If this could be done with a FHIR application and made universally available, it could simplify the process. Providers and their staff would be more likely to keep a single NDH updated, and verify it more frequently, thus improving accuracy of data. <br/><br/>Updating and adding directory entries in real time is the future. <br/>",
