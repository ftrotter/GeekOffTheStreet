      "comment" : "FROM www.MIKES-PLACE.org - As the founder of MIKES-PLACE and the parent of 2 children with catastrophic diagnosis. A directory database identifying ALL US healthcare providers, searchable by key words is the missing link in our health care system. My personal experience in 1980 to search for specialist for my daughter&#39;s undiagnosable lung condition in a fragmented healthcare system was near impossible, and then in 2013 as my son battled the diagnosis of Colon Cancer, I found the healthcare system equally fragmented. My goal for Mikes-Place.org (501c3 Non-Profit foundation) is to be the connecter for individuals and families facing life altering diagnosis. This database will be instrumental to making  this a reality. <br/>I would welcome the opportunity to be involved in this project.<br/>Karen Shannon, Karenshannon216@gmail.com  , 410-627-6293<br/>",
