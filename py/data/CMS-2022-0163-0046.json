      "comment" : "The Request for Information in a National Directory of Healthcare Providers is taking our rights away as a patient. We have HIPPA for a reason. They reason is so we can share our information with whom we wish. I do not want any Health Care Facility or Doctor to know where I have been getting services or what I have got services for. It is my place to inform if I wish. CMS could consider patient portals for the patients. Then if they wished to obtain t he information and share with the Healthcare Provider that would not be an invasion of privacy. If you choose to make this Directory you will cost us all a tremendous amount of money. Definitely many of us will STOP going to the Doctors. This in turn ends up in ER visits and Urgent care visits. Please remember we have rights and we are quit tiered at this point of having them taken away. Thank you ",
