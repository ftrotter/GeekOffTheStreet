I believe a centralized Healthcare Directory would be beneficial for providers and patients if it is comprehensive, up-to-date, and if the search criteria are relevant to all parties who would be searching the directory.<br/><br/>I believe that consultation and collaboration with organizations who currently maintain national healthcare directories is essential.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) be involved to incorporate PSYPACT into the directory for psychologists who are credentialed to provide telehealth in all participating states who have passed legislation for reciprocity. A national directory needs to be searchable by each state a psychologist is credentialed through PSYPACT to offer telehealth. Currently almost all national directories are only searchable by one or two states where a psychologist is licensed. Now that over 30 states have passed legislation for psychologists to have reciprocity to offer telehealth, we need a directory that allows patients to find the psychologists who can practice telehealth in their state even when they do not have a physical office in their state.<br/><br/>I also recommend that OutCare Health be involved in collaboration and consultation, as they maintain the largest national directory of LGBTQ-affirming providers.",
