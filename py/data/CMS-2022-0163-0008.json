Having an accurate database of providers in all settings of care, including medical directors of Post-Acute and Long-Term Care facilities, will help to streamline communication and enhance accountability among the healthcare team. As a provider AND a patient in a large health system, I can think of multiple ways a national directory of healthcare providers and services would help access the right care for me, my family, and my patients.  In addition, as the state medical director of quality improvement for a Medicare iSNP, having access to an accurate list of providers our plan serves will help us elevate the quality of care we can provide.
