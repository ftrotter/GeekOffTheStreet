If the information was in 100 different patient portals it would be much safer. At least if one place was hacked by someone we would still have many places where our records would remain. I also do not think that the Federal Government should be allowed to hold our valuable Health Information. It is not the Governments business what our Medical condition is. This would be open to any Medical provider including Insurance companies. They would have the opportunity to see our illnesses and then not insure us. It is a very bad idea. ",
