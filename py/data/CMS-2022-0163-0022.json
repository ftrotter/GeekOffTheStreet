      "comment" : "I thinks that providers need to list each clinic location and hospitals that they have privleges at. Many PCPs belong to multiple clinics and multiple hospitals and sometimes patients are capped at a specific hospital. They need to state what the name of their IPA is or physician group(s) they are with and what Medi-caid/ <br/>(Medi-cal)Insurances they accept, if they are seeing new patients, Thier Bios and education and make sure that they keep the national Directory current. Please require physicians provide letters in advance to patients prior to a contract termination when patients have scheduled surgeries or belong to a specific transplant team, on an organ transplant wait list,with a contracted hospital. When thier IPAs and hospitals contracts with insurance companies terminate, the patient has to get a new PCP, and re-referred to all new Specialists and then start from the beginning again. This is WASTEFUL and a dis-service to patients. Many hospitals will not doe letters of agreement for Continuation of care and this process takes months to get right.  I think that patientsa also get really confused when they belong with a Multispecialty Clinic and see a different physician each time. Many report they do not even know who their official PCP is. This is also true for clinics who have residency programs and member&#39;s think their resident is their PCP and then they are no longer at the clinic anyomore. Member&#39;s confuse REAL MDs, whit physicians, DO&#39;s, NP&#39;s, and P.A.&#39;s and bascially do not know who to go to for specific referral requests as anyone under a REAL MD  has limits to who they refer to and patients end up with substandard care from low quality providers.
