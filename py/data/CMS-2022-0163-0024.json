Primary doctors in Medicare Book say &quot;accepting Medicaid&quot;,  but office will differ. HMO Dual Plans do not provide therapist or available primary doctors. Health plans need a big over haul. Doctors love Supplement Insurance or PPO Insurance but Medicaid Members can&#39;t afford those. Insurance companies who accept Medicare should be forced to accept an assigned percentage of Medicaid Members. ",
