      "comment" : "Thank you for allowing us to comment. This is a very bad and dangerous system to put in place for patients. A National Registry would create a portal for any healthcare professional to go into and find what all of our medical issues are. Many of us have very involved issues and illness. We already have the hardest time finding Doctors for our selves and family members when we have ALS, Intellectually delayed, Disabilities, Major medical anomalies, etc. If this takes place we and many other people will not get any care in this country. You already allow Doctor&#39;s to chose their patients instead of us being able to pick our Doctor&#39;s. The Registry is also a infringement of our Privacy Rights. I do not want just any Dr., MA, Nurse, NP, etc. to have my personal information or my medical history. It&#39;s wrong,. We are already losing our rights and this is another way of taking them away. We pay more than any doctor pays per month for insurance and you are worried about a $1000.00 a month that a Doctor wants to save. We want to save and there are not incentives or rules that allow us a savings on insurance. We pay more than that a month for our families. If you have to create this registry then  the only person that should be allowed to enter the portal should be the patient. Then if we wish to give the Dr. the information we will. I am begging you to not do this. It will restrict many people from getting the care that they so desperately need. Thank you again for allowing our comments. ",
