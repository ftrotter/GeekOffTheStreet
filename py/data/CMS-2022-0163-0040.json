      "comment" : "Contemporary and comprehensive directories can support a variety of use cases, such as helping consumers choose a provider, comparing health plan networks, auditing network adequacy, and coordinating patients&#39; care.<br/>Having a provider base for consumers seems like a really good idea. The problem is that insurance companies never keep up thier portion of the update. We do not know who the doctors are in the networks we utilize. I highly doubt that CMS creating this will make any difference. CMS putting patient&#39;s care into a data bank is NOT ok. We the consumers want our privacy when it comes to our healthcare. I do not want every Doctor or facility to know what I have had done medically in my past. This should be PRIVATE unless we want to share our information. What will happen is people will stop going to the Doctor which will cost us all more money to support the industry. What CMS should do is make this registry but only make it available to the consumer. Then if we wish to pass it on we will. An Example: If my doctor will not order a test then I have to go and private pay for the test. What right does that Doctor have seeing what I privately paid? Doctor&#39;s make plenty of money and it should not always be that the people lose their privacy in order that the Doctor gets to save a bit of money on their systems they don&#39;t want to keep up due to the expense. PRIVACY and we have a right to PRIVACY. Do not take our privacy away. Thank you for allowing us to comment. ",
