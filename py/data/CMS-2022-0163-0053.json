We employ Community Health Workers to reduce barriers and connect our participants to much-needed resources&mdash;including transportation, shelter, foodbanks, employment services, and healthcare providers. These resources sometimes take months to gather, highlighting our fractured healthcare system and lack of services. For example, we often find listings of available providers and services, only to call and learn that they are no longer accepting new patients or they are no longer in service. A National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services will help solve this problem if it includes community services and is updated regularly. We strongly support a robust and accurate National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services.",
